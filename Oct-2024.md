## *10/16/24* Figuring out how to [mess] around with Edgenuity *[during school] vs. (after school)*
### [ During School ]
- Network Blocks, **BLOCKED** Everything needed (Web Wise).
- Extension Blocks are **no problem**, have had a bypass for a while.
- Javascript Bookmarks (Bookmarklets) **BLOCKED** [Interstellar can be used to bypass]

### Documentation - [During School] *optimal*

***sub-investigation*** 
  before just jumping into it, ive done some testing a couple days before to see what what i was dealing with, and, oh boy. this may be challenging.
  -any way ive tested, its not possible to make any sort of Interstellar link, Github Codespaces wont launch.
  this is specifically dificult for me, since Intrstellar has a plugin inside the proxy-browser thats basically inspect element.
  this plugin is the only bypass for Bookmarklets being blocked i was able to find. so not being able to make Interstellar links at school, sucks.

other than that, everything should move smoothly after i get Interstellar up and running.
Edgentweaks is the JS ill be using to [mess] around with Engenuity, it can be found in the source code under Edgentweaks.txt and in Releases under V1.0.0


## *10/16/24* Figured out a posibble bypass, BYOD.
while racking my brain, thinking "i wish i could just take my Desktop PC to school", then i thought, i could do this on a mobile device, now im not suggesting my phone (school wouldnt allow that anyway) im gonna use some little burner tablet that cant be traced back to me (just in case cheating is suspected) ive been lacking behind in my edgenuity work so ill have to catch up soon!

### how would you use a crappy little tablet to bypass stuff on edgenuity?
  - Download a VPN (Google Play or an APK)
  - Download Kiwi Browser  **↥↥↥**
  - Go to the Extensions page and Search for TamperMonkey
  - use the Edgentweaks in this repo
    BOOM! your now creating your path to good grades!
