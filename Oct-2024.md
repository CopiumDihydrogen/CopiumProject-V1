# *10/16/24* Figuring out how to [mess] around with Edgenuity *[during school] vs. (after school)*
### [ During School ]
- Network Blocks, **BLOCKED** Everything needed (Web Wise).
- Extension Blocks are **no problem**, have had a bypass for a while.
- Javascript Bookmarks (Bookmarklets) **BLOCKED** [Interstellar can be used to bypass]

### Documentation - [During School] *optimal*

***sub-investigation*** 
  before just jumping into it, ive done some testing a couple days before to see what what i was dealing with, and, oh boy. this may be challenging.
  -any way ive tested, its not possible to make any sort of Interstellar link, Github Codespaces wont launch.
  this is specifically dificult for me, since Intrstellar has a plugin inside the proxy-browser thats basically inspect element.
  this plugin is the only bypass for Bookmarklets being blocked i was able to find. so not being able to make Interstellar links at school, sucks.

other than that, everything should move smoothly after i get Interstellar up and running.
Edgentweaks is the JS ill be using to [mess] around with Engenuity, it can be found in the source code under Edgentweaks.txt and in Releases under V1.0.0
